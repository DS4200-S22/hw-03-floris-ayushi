                    There are two data types that are shown in the stacked bar chart. Categorical for the data along the horizontal axis,
                and sequential quantitative data in each category. The marks can be seen as lines with thickness
                or area as rectangles. The channels are both the vertical and horizontal postions to determine the 
                heights of each bar, as well as colors to indicate the comparison between different datasets, 
                or a part-to-whole comparison. Here, marks are used as items since it shows the quantity in a 
                category for an item.

                    The data shown in a mind map is categorical since there is a central category which is connected
                to any number of other categorical data using a link data type to indicate a relationship. The marks in this network are connection links between the different
                categorical data. The channels are the horizontal and vertical postion again since these dictate the structure
                of the connections in the mind map. The channels are also colors since the different colors indicate different
                types of the categorical data displayed.

                    There are two data types that are shown in the bump chart. One is categorical to compare the different
                    categories, and the other is ordered sequential (because it is discrete) and is usually time which shows how the different 
                    categories change for each of the times. The marks in this case can be considered as points to represent
                    the nodes, and they are linked by connection marks to reveal the way corresponding category changes. 
                    The channels are horizontal and vertical positon to show how the category increases or decreases (vertical positioning)
                    over the different times (horizontal postioning). It also conveys how the different categories compare to eachother
                    due to the fluctuations in the positioning for each category. Another channel is color, since each color represents
                    each category so that is is more visually perceptive to track the changes that occur over time for each category.

                There is categorical data shown in the slices of each pie, as well as quantitative data in the form of part-to-whole 
                to represent the percentages or slices of the pie. There is additional sequential quantitative data shown in the positioning of each of
                the pies along the horizontal and vertical axes. The marks are areas which are slices of the pie and these represent items. 
                The channels are horiztontal and vertical postitioning along each axis, as well as tilts/angles in the slices of the pies to reperesent
                the size of each pie. There are also colors for the different percentages of the pie to represent the different
                categorical data in each pie. Lastly, the actual size of the pies also represent an additional quantitative data since the sizes can
                vary.
